When the type of semiconductor and the radius of the dot are chosen, our program will be able to output a graphical representation of the quantum energy levels and the color of the quantum dot. Specifically, the radius can be controlled through a slider. The semiconductor material can be chosen from given buttons, or the user can type in a compound they want to test. 
Our program will output:
    A vial that lights up with a beautiful array of vibrant colors;
    A short animation of the electron on the valence and conduction bands
    Numerical values for the energy of the quantum dot and the wavelength of light
    The colour in words (eg.: “red”, “green”, “blue”, etc.)
